8:05 - 9:00: Work in Figma to brainstorm how users might want to query the API so I can figure out what key words and info to include in my API


9:00 - 10:00: Research if possible to send over more than one ingredient at a time to swap for an API query

10:15 - 11:00: Create Google Sheet to start entering data and plant subs for my API. Still contemplating best way to organize the queries. Also, researching Walmart in various mid-West/non-Portland cities to understand what kind of products are available in other parts of the country. Portland has a lot to offer vegans, I want to offer everyone the ability to find subs.
